Things I did not have time to implement:

- Actual Routing (maybe React Router)
- Use better state management (Redux?)
- Polish UI More, add better mobile support (Right now the sidebar just disappears in medium-sized devices or smaller)
- I did not know what to put in the instructor area as it did not seem to be in the JSON
- The detail view should have been an overlay probably

The only important thing these entail is that in CodeSandbox the window may not be big enough to show the sidebar, so opening it in a new window is recommended so you can see the sidebar (Of course you can resize later, it's just otherwise you just won't see it)

I also made a Carta concept, not following Stanford's design language but a more modern minimalist design (along with a new logo): <https://l.edm.sh/carta-proto>
