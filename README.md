Things I did not have time to implement:

- Actual Routing (maybe React Router)
- Use better state management (Redux?)
- Polish UI More, add better mobile support (Right now the sidebar just disappears, no way to bring it back)
- I did not know what to put in the instructor area as it did not seem to be in the JSON
- The detail view should have been an overlay probably

I also made a Carta concept, not following Stanford's design language but a more modern minimalist design (along with a new logo): <https://l.edm.sh/carta-proto>
